# MoodSync

**MoodSync** adjusts the brightness of your smart bulbs based on your emotions. It uses a basic emotion detection model to create a more personalized and responsive environment.

### Current Status
- Works with smart bulbs to adjust brightness in real-time.
- Emotion detection is functional but could be improved with a better dataset.

### Future Potential
- Improved accuracy with a larger dataset.
- Support for more emotions.

MoodSync is a work in progress with room to grow.
